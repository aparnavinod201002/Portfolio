        <h1>JOHN M.GRUNFELD</h1>
        <h2>Astronaut & Astronomer |<br> Former Associate Adminstrator for<br> NASA's Science Mission Directorate</h2>
        <p>As an astronaut who operated on Hubble multiple times in orbit, Dr. John Grunsfeld has a unique relationship with the telescope. He’s watched Hubble drift against the background of Earth and stars, and he’s guided new parts and instruments into the telescope and left it whole and healthy.

            “Once you’re outside working, you know, all the rest of the world disappears,” he once told the New York Times about working on Hubble. “Once in a while the universe lets you be free alone and in peace.”
            His quest to become an astronaut started at 6 years old. As a child, he toted a lunch box decorated with a NASA Gemini theme, celebrating an early human spaceflight program. His mother was happy to encourage him, he noted at an awards ceremony. “She thought it would help my interest in science and math and she said there’s no chance I’d ever actually become an astronaut, so she didn’t have to worry.”

            The desire to explore space had turned to an interest in physics and cosmology by the time he started college at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned a bachelor's degree in physics. After some time in Japan ― where he worked with University of Tokyo astronomer Professor Minoru Oda ― he returned to Chicago and obtained a master's degree and a doctorate in physics from the University of Chicago, basing his doctoral thesis project on cosmic ray data collected by an experiment on the Space Shuttle Challenger.</p>

        <h2>Spaceflight experience</h2>
        <p>STS-67 Astro-2 Space Shuttle Endeavour (March 2–18, 1995) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was the second flight of the Astro observatory, a unique complement of three ultra-violet telescopes. During this record-setting 16-day mission, the crew conducted observations around the clock to study the far ultraviolet spectra of faint astronomical objects and the polarization of ultraviolet light coming from hot stars and distant galaxies. Mission duration was 399 hours and 9 minutes.

            STS-81 Space Shuttle Atlantis (January 12–22, 1997) was a 10-day mission, the fifth to dock with Russia's Mir space station, and the second to exchange U.S. astronauts. The mission also carried the Spacehab double module providing additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments. In five days of docked operations more than three tons of food, water, experiment equipment and samples were moved back and forth between the two spacecraft. Grunsfeld served as the flight engineer on this flight. Following 160 orbits of the Earth the STS-81 mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy Space Center's Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey. Mission duration was 244 hours, 56 minutes. During this flight, Grunsfeld placed a phone call to NPR's auto-repair radio show, Car Talk. In this call he complained about the performance of his serial-numbered, Rockwell-manufactured "government van". To wit, it would run very loud and rough for about two minutes, quieter and smoother for another six and a half, and then the engine would stop with a jolt. He went on to state that the brakes of the vehicle, when applied, would glow red-hot, and that the vehicle's odometer displayed "about 60 million miles". This created some consternation for the hosts, until they noticed the audio of Grunsfeld's voice, being relayed from Mir via TDRS satellite, sounded similar to that of Tom Hanks in the then-recent film Apollo 13, after which they realized the call was from space and the government van in question was, in fact, the Space Shuttle.[19]
            
            STS-103 Space Shuttle Discovery (December 19–27, 1999) was an eight-day mission during which the crew successfully installed new gyroscopes and scientific instruments and upgraded systems on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Enhancing HST scientific capabilities required three spacewalks (EVA). Grunsfeld performed two spacewalks totaling 16 hours and 23 minutes. The STS-103 mission was accomplished in 120 Earth orbits, traveling 3.2 million miles in 191 hours and 11 minutes.
            
            STS-109 Space Shuttle Columbia (March 1–12, 2002) was the fourth Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission. The crew of STS-109 successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope installing a new digital camera, a cooling system for the infrared camera, new solar arrays and a new power system. HST servicing and upgrades were accomplished by four crewmembers during a total of five EVAs in five consecutive days. Grunsfeld served as the payload commander on STS-109 in charge of the space walking activities and the Hubble payload. He also performed three spacewalks totaling 21 hours and 9 minutes, including the installation of the new Power Control Unit. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times, and covered 3.9 million miles in over 262 hours.
            
            STS-125 Space Shuttle Atlantis (May 11–24, 2009) was the fifth and final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. Atlantis launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Pad 39A May 11, 2009, at 2:01 p.m. EDT, and landed on May 24, 2009 at California's Edwards Air Force Base.[20][21] During the mission, Grunsfeld performed three of the mission's five back-to-back spacewalks, which installed two new instruments to the Hubble Space Telescope: The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, and the Wide Field Camera 3. The mission also replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor, six new gyroscopes, and two battery unit modules, to allow the telescope to continue to function at least through 2014.[22][23] One issue Grunsfeld and his crew experienced during the overhaul was the stripping of 10mm bolts due to improper assembly and technique which he discussed again on Car Talk.
            
            Grunsfeld has logged over 58 days in space, including eight space walks totaling 58 hours and 30 minutes.[24][25]<br><br>

            <h2> NASA Career</h2>
            <p>Grunsfeld was selected by NASA in March 1992 as an astronaut candidate and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He completed one year of training and qualified for flight selection as a mission specialist. Grunsfeld was initially detailed to the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch and was assigned as the lead for portable computers for use in space. Following his first flight, he led a team of engineers and computer programmers tasked with defining and producing the crew displays for command and control of the International Space Station (ISS). As part of this activity, he directed an effort combining the resources of the Mission Control Center (MCC) Display Team and the Space Station Training Facility. The result was the creation of the Common Display Development Facility (CDDF), responsible for the onboard and MCC displays for the International Space Station, using object-oriented programming techniques. Following his second flight, he was assigned as Chief of the Computer Support Branch in the Astronaut Office supporting Space Shuttle and International Space Station Programs and advanced technology development. Following STS-103, he served as Chief of the Extravehicular Activity Branch in the Astronaut Office. Following STS-109, Grunsfeld served as an instructor in the Extravehicular Activity Branch, and worked on the Orbital Space Plane, exploration concepts, and technologies for use beyond low-Earth orbit in the Advanced Programs Branch. He served as NASA Chief Scientist assigned to NASA Headquarters from 2003 to 2004. In January 2012, he became the associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA's headquarters in Washington, replacing Ed Weiler.[9]

                Grunsfeld has been actively engaged in communicating space science topics to the public through interviews, public lectures, and television appearances. He was interviewed by NASA's Astrobiology Magazine about the James Webb Space Telescope[10] and at the Science with Hubble Space Telescope III conference in Venice, Italy, about carrying out repairs and upgrades on the Hubble Space Telescope.[11] His public lectures include Hugging Hubble at the Space Telescope Science Institute's May, 2010, Symposium,[12] Big Science Questions at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Aspen Center for Physics[13] and The Hubble Story presented as a special public lecture at Oxford University's department of physics.[14] He has made several television appearances to discuss the successful landing of the Mars Curiosity rover in August 2012 and its mission, including appearances on the PBS NewsHour with Judy Woodruff,[15] the Colbert Report,[16][17] and on NASA television.[18]
                
                On April 5, 2016, Grunsfield announced his retirement from NASA, starting April 30.
